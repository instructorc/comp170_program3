#  MPLS care attendant Daily Log

The MPLS care attendant Daily Dog Log is a program that allows the care attendant manager to  enter daily logs for each Dog in MPLS Dog boarding School.  
Listed below is a chart with the name of each care attendant and the name of each dog in their care.  The program allows the care attendant to continuously 
enter their id# and enter the total amount of time spent with the dog and a general note about the dog's day. Once the care attendant id # is entered, the care attendant
will be prompted to select the dogs who fall under their care.  For each dog entered, The program provides a summary of all entered information for a dog. The program should enforce that only care attendants with the id numbers listed in the chart below can be entered.    

Once the manager is done entering all logs, the program will display a count of total dogs entered, a count of the total number of dogs entered from each 
color group, along with the total time the care attendant spent with the various dogs. 

Your program should operate similarly to the program shown in the .gif below
